Done in python3.6

Libraries Used : 

In static.py
pickle, os, numpy, csv, warnings, sklearn

Main Code : 
1) static.py -> Final Code that takes the path containing malware and benign files and output the static.csv file.

To test for training done logically :  
1) Simply run training.py (it loads features from features.npy (that i have already provided))
2) And to save the model you can run train_full_data.py

-----These were used on the data set provided to us for training model----
1) training.py -> I used logistic regression, CSVM, Decision Trees and found best results using Decision Tree Classifiers
2) train_full_data -> This script train the entire data set and saves the model in file model.sav

1) NumberOfSections
2) NumberOfSymbols
3) SizeOfOPtionalHeader

12)SizeOfStackCommit:
13)SizeOfHeapReserve:
14)SizeOfHeapCommit:
15)NumberOfRvaAndSizes:
-------16 to 21 are binary features, if these sections are present, then value is 1 otherwise 0--------
16).text
17).rdata
18).data
19).rsrc
20).idata
21).reloc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22)NumberOfFunctions:
23)NumberOfNames:
23)Number of DLLS imported
24)Number of strings

Feature Selected : 
Some of the features like NumberOfSymbols, SizeOfOptionalHeader, SizeOfStackCommit, SizeOfHeapCommit, NumberOfRvaAndSizes: had similar values in all the files, so i removed them during feature selection.
