This project was done as a mid term assignment of Malware Analysis and Intrusion Detection. We were given static and dynamic analysis of 5113 malware files and 5125 benign files and we need to learn a machine learning model to classify them by first extracting the relevant features from the static and dynamic analysis and then using these features to to train a model to classify them correctly.
