Done in python3.6

Libraries Used : 

pickle, os, json, numpy, csv, sklearn, warnings

Main Code : 
1) dynamic.py : Final code that takes as input the path of directory containing malware and benign files, performs
		feature selection, run the trained model on these features and output the dynamic.csv file.

To test for training done correctly : 
1) You can run training.py (it loads features from features.npy (that i have already provided)) 
2) And to check model being saved properly, you can run train_full_data.py
